 | Backwards compatibility breaks and advisories |
 +-----------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------+
| Stable release April 2013 |
+---------------------------+

 o All of the chart libraries are changing how they add methods to objects. Currently the methods are added using the prototype method:
    
    RGraph.Fuel.prototype.Draw = function ()
    {
    }

   However now the chart types will be moving to have the methods assigned in the constructor - for example:
   
   this.Draw = function ()
   {
   }
   
   From an end user perspective though nothing changes - the API remains the same - for example:
   
   var fuel = new RGraph.Fuel('cvs', 0,100,78);
   fuel1.Draw();
 o The Bipolar option chart.ylabels.count is now chart.labels.count
 o The default value for chart.key.position.gutter.boxed has changed from true to false
  o The Bar chart now supports null data entries. If you use null entries you will need to account for them in other
    arrays - such as tooltips

+---------------------------+
| Stable release March 2013 |
+---------------------------+

 o The HBar chart.gutter.top setting has changed from 35 to 25.
 o The RGraph.GetDays() function has been removed
 o The Line chart numyticks setting has changed (when the X axis is in the center) - as a result you may need
   to double or halve the number specified
 o The Line chart option chart.ylabels.specific now span the entire axis  - so this means that you may have to add an extra
   empty element to your array
 o The HBar chart.labels.colors and chart.xlabels.colors have been removed
 o The CornerGauge option chart.value.text.sizenow defaults to 18 instead of null
 o The HProgress options hart.title.hpos and chart.title.vpos have both been removed - use chart.title.x and chart.title.y instead
 o The VProgress options hart.title.hpos and chart.title.vpos have both been removed
 o The Radar chart option chart.labels.specific is now used in reverse order. So the first label given will be nearest the center.
 o The Bar chart variants arrow and pyramid have been removed
 o On scaled charts (eg bar chart, line chart, scatter chart etc) if a scale uses exponentials it goes 0-10 instead of
   either 0-10 OR 0-5.
 o The RGraph.getGutterSuggest function has been removed
 o If you use a  custom number labels with the VProgress the option may need adjusting. You now need to use the option:
   chart.labels.count
 o The default gradient for the Thermometer has been altered slightly
 o The default for the Line chart chart.ymin property has been changed from null to 0
 o The Scatter chart default for chart.ymin has been changed from null to 0
  o The Line chart option chart.ylabels.invert is now called chart.scale.invert
  o The Thermometer chart property chart.ylabels.count has been changed to chart.labels.count
  o The VProgrss properties chart.title.hpos and chart.title.vpos have been removed
  o The zoom option chart.zoom.background has been removed. Now it's always shown
  o The ZoomWindow and ZoomArea function have now been removed from RGraph altogether
  o The zoom background is now always shown - the setting has been removed. The color of it has also been changed to semi-opaaque white
  
+-----------------------------+
| Stable release January 2013 |
+-----------------------------+

 o The Drawing API objects no longer add themselves as the canvas.__object__ reference
 o The getObjectsByType() and getFirstObjectByType() ObjectRegistry methods have been updated. They now accept just
   the desired type as the sole argument and return the applicable object(s). for example:
   
   var obj = RGraph.ObjectRegistry.getObjectsByType(gauge');
   var obj = RGraph.ObjectRegistry.getFirstObjectByType('bar');

 o The adjusting docs pages URLs have changed - you may need to update links if you have them
 o The Bar chart options chart.labels.colors and chart.ylabels.colors have been removed
 o The placement indicator of the RGraph.Text function has been removed
 o The Radar chart option chart.background.circles.spacing has ben removed
 o The Waterfall linewidth default has been changed to 1
 o The Waterfall default strokestyle has been changed to gray
 o The RGraph.Text() now only measures the text if it contains \r\n. Also - if it does measure the text the DIV used is kept now and
   reused if the RGraph.MeasureText() function is used again. This results in significant speed improvments (particularly in animations)
   across the whole of RGraph.
 o The argument list for the HProgress and VProgress has changed to match other meters.gauges. The new constructor looks like this:

    vprogress = new RGraph.VProgress('cvs', 0,100,89);
    hprogress = new RGraph.HProgress('cvs', 0,100,89);

   Which gives you progress bars with a minimum of 0, a maximum of 100 and an indicated value of 89.
 o NB As of the next release (February) the DrawXAxis() and DrawYAxis() API functions are being converted to drawing API objects.
      This will make them easier to use and mean less code for you to write.
 o The DrawXAxis() and DrawYAxis() configuration options are now prefixed with chart. and not axis. Eg: chart.x, chart.hnargin,
   chart.title etc

+------------------------------+
| Stable release December 2012 |
+------------------------------+

  o The minify PHP script has been removed
  o The Radar chart default for chart.axes.color has changed from black to rgba(0,0,0,0)
  o The Radar chart default for chart.background.circles.poly has changed to true
  o The way that the Y coordinates for lines has changed significantly. There shouldn't be any visible changes.
  o Some code that handles a bit of BC for the Meter chart in IE8/7 has been removed. Charts should not be affected though
  o The rotateIn animation now rotates in from the left (10px)

+------------------------------+
| Stable release November 2012 |
+------------------------------+

 o The RGraph.Reset() method has been updated so that it now removes all relevant objects from the ObjectRegistry. You may find
   it easier to use and more clear then manually clearing the ObjectRegistry. In many cases you can just replace your .Clear()
   call with a .Reset() call. Note that any translation that has been performed will be lost as well. If you want the old Reset
   method it's very easy to make one (or use this):
   
   function myReset (canvas)
   {
       canvas.width = canvas.width;
   }

 o The default for the Radar chart chart.labels.boxed has changed from true to false
 o The default color for H/VProgress tickmarks is now gray instead of black
 o The HProgress and VProgress default for chart.tickmarks.zerostart has changed to true - so now progress bars will show
   zero by default

+-----------------------------+
| Stable release October 2012 |
+-----------------------------+

 o IMPORTANT: How you specify the Gantt chart events has changed. Instead of using the chart.events property the events are
              now given as the second argument to the constructor. The array is the same format. If you use the Gantt chart
              and are upgrading you WILL need to adjust your code.
  o  The HBar settings chart.vmargin and chart.vmargin.grouped for grouped HBars have been updated to act the same as the Bar chart.
     The chart.vmargin setting is used to seperate the groups of bars whilst the chart.vmargin.grouped setting is used to seperate
     individual bars within the group.
  o The position of the key in gutter mode has been updated - it's now centered regardless of the gutter settings
  o With the addition of easy gradients a lot of the default colors have changed. You therefore may find that the colors on
    your chart have changed.
  o The Odometer options chart.green.solid, chart.yellow.solid and chart.red.solid have been removed. The green/yellow/red colors
    can be made solid with the following settings:
    
    obj.Set('chart.green.color', 'green');
    obj.Set('chart.yellow.color', 'yellow');
    obj.Set('chart.red.color', 'red');
 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Stable release September 2012                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  o When upgrading the Scatter chart - please check your charts are OK - changes have been made to the Scatter with regard to
    handling null values
  o The Line chart option chart.curvy is now called chart.spline
  o The strokeStyle for the box enclosing the key has been changed to #999
  o The default positioning for the key in gutter mode has changed to be at the bottom of the top gutter
  o The positioning of Y axis titles has been altered with the Bar/Line/Scatter/Waterfall/HBar - check your charts
  o The Pie chart Wave effect has been removed
  o The Pie chart chart.segments has been removed - use obj.angles instead
  o The Pie chart Explode() method no longer resets chart.exploded when it's called
  o The default color for the Fuel chart is now a gradient (white -> red)
  o The default colors for the HProgress and VProgress have been changed to gradients
  o The Scatter chart getValue() method has been renamed to getYValue()
  o The way that the Bipolar uses colors has ben brought into line with other chart types. Now to use colors in a sequential
    fashion you must specify the chart.colors.sequential
 o The skeleton file has been removed. A good base for creating your own chart is one of the drawing API files,
   eg RGraph.common.drawing.rect.js

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Stable release June 2012                                                       |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o The compressed version of the ExCanvas library is no longer bundled with RGraph
 o The documentation and examples will no longer be bundled as part of the RGraph archive. To view them youwill need to visit the
   RGraph website
 o The Pie chart Explode() method no longer resets chart.exploded when it's called

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Stable release May 2012                                                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o The chart.taper option now defaults to false
 o Defaults for some charts have been changed:
    o Bipolar - The default strokestyle is now transparent
    o Funnel chart - the default strokestyle is now transparent
    o Radar chart - the default strokestyle has been changed to #aaa, rgba(255,0,0,0.5) has been added to the default colors
    o Rose chart - the default colors have been changed
 o The RGraph.Tooltip() function now takes an extra argument - the event object
 o If you use charts involving the use of Pi (ie Fuel, Gauge, Meter, Odometer, Pie, Radar, Rose, RScatter, Thermometer) please take
   extra care to check your charts as Math.PI has been replace by three constants: HALFPI, PI and TWOPI
 o The default strokestyle for the HBar has changed to transparent
 o NB: The Rose chart now uses the RGraph.getAngleByXY() common method
 o The default overflow: CSS setting for tooltips is now set to '' in each charts .positionTooltip() function
 o The order of array based tickmarks and how they corrrespond with lines has been reversed
 o The Radar chart coords array is now single dimensional instead of multie to match other chart types
 o The default strokestyle for the HBar has changed from black to transparent
 o The default for the chart.key property is now null for all charts
 o Some of the defaults (eg shadow, colors) have changed for the Bar chart
 o The Rose chart Grow effect has been renamed to RoundRobin
 o The Pie chart RoundRobin effect now defaults to growing the radius. You can turn this off if you prefer using the options - eg:
   
   RGraph.Effects.Pie.RoundRobin(myObj, {'radius': false});
   
   The number of frames has also changed from 60 to 90 and you can change this back with:
   
   RGraph.Effects.Pie.RoundRobin(myObj, {'frames': 60});

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Stable release March 2012                                                        |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
 o The argument list for the RGraph.Redraw() function has changed - it no longer takes a canvas id/color. It only accepts an
   optional color
 o Background images have been reverted to being painted on to the canvas. They've have also been converted to work with multiple
   charts on the same canvas
 o The Gauge chart option chart.border.gradient now defaults to false
 o If you use annotating you need to specifically clear annotations now - they're not cleared as part of the .Clear() API function.
   Eg: RGraph.ClearAnnotations(myCanvas.id);
 o The HBar background bar colors have changed from white to transparent
 o Adjusting has been updated - you may need to check or update your charts
 o If you use a dynamic feature (eg Tooltips, zoom or annotating) you need to remember to include the file RGraph.common.dynamic.js
 o The core function RGraph.lineByAngle has been removed
 o Now that individual gutters can be configured, the HBar chart.labels.above is ALWAYS "a\bove" the bar, and not positioned
   within the bar. As a result you may need to increase your right gutter. 
 o Tooltips and a few dynamic features have been moved to a new file: RGraph.common.dynamic.js You may need to include this file
 o The __index2__ property is being removed. Instead you can now use the "dataset" and "index" properties
 o The resize cursor is now the pointer
 o The name of the coordinates for the interactive has changed to: obj.coords.key
 o Radar chart adjusting has been temporarily removed
 o The default setting for chart.highlight.stroke is now transparent (ie rgba(0,0,0,0) )
 o The HBar default highlight fill is now slightly less opaque
 o The HBar default highlight stroke is now transparent - not black
 o The tooltip override functions first argument is the object - NOT the canvas
 o The tooltip "snap" effect now always originates from the top left of the page.
 o Because of the need now to register all objects (in their constructors), if you use multiple effects on one page - some of
   which aren't initially drawn - they may be redrawn because of other animations on the page. If you need to keep them hidden
   you can use the "visibility" or "display" CSS properties.
 o The effects now only redraw the specific canvas that they're animating - regardless of other canvases on the page
 o Combined Bar and Line charts may need attention - you may need to match the gutter settings (so they're the same on the
   Bar and Line charts) as this is not done for you any more.
 o If you have multiple charts drawn on a single canvas, perhaps shown depending on a button (or similar), because charts
   are now ALWAYS registered with the new object registry, all objects that are linked to a canvas will be redrawn when
   RGraph.Redraw() is called. There is a .Remove(obj) method that you can use to un-register an objects, eg:
   
    RGraph.ObjectRegistry.Remove(obj);
    
   An example of this is: http://www.rgraph.net/docs/howto-make-a-transition-effect.html
 o The Thermometer coords array structure has changed. Where as you use to reference obj.coords, you will need to now
   reference obj.coords[0].
 o The Pie now uses the gutters ONLY for positioning. So the chart.align property is deprecated
 o How the Odometer works out the centerx and centery has changed. Though can override these if you wish with:
    o chart.centerx
    o chart.centery
    o chart.radius
 o How the Meter works out the centerx and centery has changed. Though can override these if you wish with:
    o chart.centerx
    o chart.centery
    o chart.radius
 o The Radar chart .size property is now called .diameter
 o The Gauge chart now has a graduated border. It defaults to being enabled, but you can turn it off with
   chart.border.gradient if you prefer

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Stable release 13th January 2012                                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o The ModalDialog has been altered so that it is ALWAYS (re)created when it is shown - ie it is no longer cached once it
   has been created
 o The Y axis title positioning has been adjusted - so please check yours if it's on the right.
 o The RGraph.getTooltipTextFromDIV() function has had its return value changed. If no id: tag is found it returns an empty string
 o Unlike prior beta releases, if you specify an empty function for the chart.events.mousemove option this no longer
   automatically changes the cursor to a hand. If you want this you specify this instead:
   obj.Set('chart.events.mousemove', function (e) {e.target.style.cursor = 'pointer';});
   The existing pointer will be saved and reverted to when necessary.
 o The RScatter .getPoint() method no longer checks to see if there is an associated tooltip defined for a point.
 o The Radar chart .getPoint method no longer checks too if there is an associated tooltip defined for a point
 o On the Radar chart if you turn off the background circles the diagonals will now not be drawn
 o If you use the internal Radar property .data, you may need to change this to .original_data eg: myObj.original_data = ...
 o The Gantt chart default for chart.tooltips has been changed to null.
 o The Gantt chart default for chart.background.grid.autofit has been changed to true
 o The Gantt chart default for the labels position has been changed from top to bottom.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Stable release 26th November 2011                                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o chart.boxplot.width is now a SCALE value, not a PIXEL value. Therefore, if your chart.xmax value is 28 (for four
   weeks say, 1 week would be represented a value of 7, whereas before that would simply be 7 pixels.
 o The Rose chart adjusting has been removed
 o The slide in and slideout have each had the arguments used to stipulate the direction renamed:
   RGraph.Effects.jQuery.Slide.In(obj, {'from': 'right'});
   RGraph.Effects.jQuery.Slide.Out(obj, {'to': left'});
 o Is you use the Thermometer chart with a label - please check that the label is in the correct position
 o The default font has been changed to Arial. You can change it back with chart.text.font if you wish.
 o Separated out the key functionality into its own file - RGraph.common.key.js. If you use the key you will need to
   include this file. If you don't use the key this will save roughly 30k.
 o The default highlight mode for the Pie chart has been changed to "explode".
 o The Pie chart and the Rose chart .getSegment function has undergone significant changes. The main change
   being that angles are now measured in radians and not degrees. Roughly, 1 radian = 57.3 degrees If you don't
   use the API then you shouldn't notice the change, but if you do you will most likely have to update your code.

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [27-10-2011] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  o [27-10-2011] Animations in Chrome 15 can be rather slower than Chrome 14. jQuery (ie CSS) based animations are unaffected, as are
                 some canvas based animations.
  o [22-10-2011] IMPORTANT: The default positioning for titles has changed - you may need to adjust the positioning of your titles
  o [15-10-2011] The Pie chart chart.segments array is being removed (probably November or December) - use .angles array instead.
  o [15-10-2011] The Pie chart start axis has been changed to the "north" axis (instead of the "east" axis. Please test your charts!
  o [01-10-2011] Note that due FF7 had issue with the gradient used in the Odometer border so you may find that it has changed very
                 slightly

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [24-09-2011] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o [10-10-2011] The Bar, Line and Scatter charts have had the background grid autofit turned on by default. Also the number
                of horizontal grid lines has been changed to 5.
 o [03-10-2011] A change has been made to the Pie chart when using tooltips and the full canvas zoom - please test your charts
                if upgrading and you use tooltips in conjunction with the zoom.

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [27-08-2011] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o [31-08-2011] Donut/Pie chart title positioning may need attention - the default for chart.title.vpos is now 0.5
                (the vertical centre of the gutter)
 o [31-08-2011] Filled line charts have been changed - please see the changelog file for more
                information (20-08-2011). You may need to reverse your colors if you use multiple lines.

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [29-07-2011] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  o [30-07-2011] When using Line chart specific labels in conjunction with chart.ymin the label positioning
                 has changed - the labels now start at the X axis vertical position.
  o [20-07-2011] The chart.segments option is no longer mmaintained - use obj.angles instead
  o [20-07-2011] When adding a Line chart to a Bar chart some of the Line chart properties are no longer set for you -
                 you will need to set these yourself if you want them. They are (along with what they were set to):

                    lineObj.Set('chart.noaxes', true);
                    lineObj.Set('chart.background.barcolor1', 'rgba(0,0,0,0)');
                    lineObj.Set('chart.background.barcolor2', 'rgba(0,0,0,0)');
                    lineObj.Set('chart.background.grid', false);
                    lineObj.Set('chart.ylabels', false);

  o [17-07-2011] The default CSS has been altered for tooltips. This affects all chart types. The changes are:
                  o There is now no CSS border to the tooltip
                  o The toltip is now transparent a small amount (opacity=0.9)
                  o The tooltip shadow X & Y offsets are now zero

                 If you wish to revert these changes you will need to use the tooltip CSS class:

                <style>
                    .RGraph_tooltip {
                        // ...
                    }
                </style>

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [12-07-2011] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o [02-07-2011] The Tradar chart has been renamed to the Radar chart. This will make more identifiable. You WILL
                need to update you code to the new name!
 o [25-06-2011] The HBar default colors have changed.
 o [18-06-2011] The Rose chart has undergone significant changes, now supporting a "stacked" Rose chart as well as
                a "non-equi-angular" variant. It also now supports chart.colors.sequential property and
                the default chart.strokestyle value has been changed to rgba(0,0,0,0.5). You may need to set the
                chart.colors.sequential (to true) to maintain BC.

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [04-06-2011] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o [04-06-2011] MAJOR BREAK: The chart.gutter property has been split into four properties:
                 o chart.gutter.left
                 o chart.gutter.right
                 o chart.gutter.top
                 o chart.gutter.bottom
                This affects all graph types (except the LED chart) so rigorous testing will be necessary if
                you choose to upgrade.
 o [14-05-2011] If you're using chart.width/chart.height, please switch to the individual gutter settings. These
                provide finer grained and more intuitive control over the gutters and certain things are done for you
                automatically, like for example adjusting coordinates for tooltips and resizing. The chart.width and
                chart.height will cease to function starting immediately.
 o [02-04-2011] The default color for background bars on the Scatter has changed from white to transparent. This was
                necessary to facilitate background images

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [26-03-2011] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
 o [12-03-2011] The RGraph.Clear() API function now clears to transparent, not white. If you wanted it to clear to white
                you could call this function from the new onclear event:

                function myClear(obj)
                {
                    obj.context.beginPath();
                    obj.context.fillStyle = 'white';
                    obj.context.fillRect(-10,-10,obj.canvas.width + 20, obj.canvas.height + 20);
                    obj.context.fill();
                }
                
                DO NOT simply use the RGraph.Clear() function in the onclear event listener function, as you will create an
                infinite loop.

 o [06-03-2011] The RGraph.getSegment() method has been moved to be a part of both the Pie and Rose objects. This means
                that if you use it you will have to change your code slightly. This change was necessary to facilitate
                Pie chart exploded segments. This change will also help prevent bugs in this function in the future.
 
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [28-01-2011] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                
 o [22-01-2011] The RGraph.Clear() function now uses a square 2,000 pixels wide & high
 o [15-01-2011] The Gantt adjusting array (kept in the RGraph registry) now uses associative/textual keys instead of numeric ones
 o [08-01-2011] The default number of Line chart X tickmarks has been altered ever-so-slightly: Now if you don't have chart.hmargin
                set then the X tickmarks will line up with the points on the chart. See the first example on the line chart test
                page for an example: http://dev.rgraph.net/tests/_line.html
 o [08-01-2011] The custom RGraph event onannotatestart has been renamed to onannotatebegin. The previous name will still work,
                but will eventually be removed.
 
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [24-12-2010] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o [04-12-2010] chart.key.vpos is now silently converted to chart.key.position.y (note that these two properies behave slightly
                differently - chart.key.position.y is an absolute coordinate). ALSO; the key has been rewritten, so check that
                your graphs are working as you expect
 o [04-12-2010] The HBar labels (from chart.labels.above) now have an extra property (chart.labels.above.decimals) which controls
                how many decimals are shown. This defaults to 0, and as a result you may need to set this if you're expecting decimals.
 
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [27-11-2010] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o [20-11-2010] For the line/bar/scatter, when the X axis is at the bottom and there is a background bar with a 
                negative start (or it results in a negative end value), you now get a warning.
 o [13-11-2010] All line chart labels are now shown, regardless of how many points on the line there are.
 o [06-11-2010] The HBar and Scatter have had their scaled handling changed slightly - now if you specify a maximum Y value,
                that is what is used.
 o [06-11-2010] The API function RGraph.getSCale(max, obj) now takes two arguments - the maximum value and the graph object.

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [30-10-2010] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o [30-10-2010] The Scatter chart can now only have 1/3/5 labels
 o [30-10-2010] The Line chart can now only have 1/3/5 labels
 o [23-10-2010] The Bar chart can now only have 1/3/5/10 labels
 o [23-10-2010] The default for chart.scale.decimals has changed, as such you may need to specify this:
                myScatter.Set('chart.scale.decimals', 0);
 o [09-10-2010] Scatter chart ticksize has changed behaviour slightly, you therefore may need to alter it slightly.

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [25-09-2010] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o [18-09-2010] For IE9 compatibility purposes, the IE8 DirectX shadow has been removed from the ModalDialog. This only affects
                MSIE8. The background is still semi-opaque.
 o [18-09-2010] The common function RGraph.isIE9() has changed to RGraph.isIE9up(). The old one will continue to work, but
                not indefinitely.
 o [11-09-2010] The Odometer properties chart.units.pre and chart.units.post have now changed to chart.value.units.pre
                and chart.value.units.post. The properties chart.units.post and chart.units.pre are now used for the main
                labels.
 o [04-09-2010] HBar and Pie charts have been moved to DOM2 event registration for tooltips
 o [04-09-2010] The RGraph.number_format() function has had its argument list changed
 o [04-09-2010] Now that RGraph is moving to DOM2 event handlers, tooltips will be incompatible with IE8

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [28-08-2010] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o [28-08-2010] Removed option to have the labels on the outside of a Meter. Now they're always on the inside of the Meter
                and there's always 11 of them (including zero)
 o [14-08-2010] Changed the HBar property chart.strokecolor to chart.strokestyle
 o [07-08-2010] The Odometer property chart.needle.thickness has been changed to chart.needle.width. Work has been done on the
                needle head.
 o [07-08-2010] Progress bar has now been split into two different graph types:
                 o HProgress
                 o VProgress
 o [07-08-2010] Progress bar property chart.color is now chart.colors, and should be an array
 o [07-08-2010] Changed default Bipolar colors to just one - green
 
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [31-07-2010] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  o [17-07-2010] Stepped line charts and their tickmarks have been marginally altered. No final tickmark is now shown (it looks
                 odd being isolated)
  o [17-07-2010] Changed the Odo chart.needle.style to chart.needle.color
  o [17-07-2010] The Odo properties chart.start, chart.end and chart.value have all been changed to internal properties:
                 obj.start, obj.end and obj.value
  o [09-07-2010] With the Odometer the old property chart.needle.style has been renamed to be chart.needle.color
  o [09-07-2010] The Progress bar has had it's properties chart.max and chart.value changed to class properties, this means
                 that if you want to make use of these, you will now need to use myProgress.value and myProgress.max.
                 myProgress being the name of your graph object.

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [26-06-2010] | Stable release                                                                        |
                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 o [08-05-2010] The Rose charts "chart.labels" property is now different to the "chart.key" property
 o [01-05-2010] The Donut chart is now a variant of the Pie chart (chart.variant = donut)
 o [24-04-2010] The radar chart has been renamed to Rose. The library is now called RGraph.rose.js and the constructor has
                been renamed. It has also been prettied up marginally and labels have been added.
 o [17-04-2010] All charts have had their property "chart.tooltip.effect" renamed to "chart.tooltips.effect".
                The Scatter chart has also had its property "chart.tooltip.hotspot" renamed to "chart.tooltips.hotspot"
 o [17-04-2010] Default chart.tooltips bar chart property has changed from an empty array to null.
 o [17-04-2010] The RGraph.common.js library has now been split into 5 separate files because it had
                become far too large. You can read the new implementation details here:
                http://www.rgraph.net/docs/index.html#implementation
 o [10-04-2010] The "coords" arrays (for each object) have been unified. Now you no longer need to take
                into account the margins. What you get in the coords arrays are as they are used on the
                graph.

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 o [27-03-2010] | Initial stable release                                                                |
